## 🎯 Scenario 1: Real-Time Fraud Detection

### **Situation**
At 14:35 on a Tuesday afternoon, the fraud detection system flags unusual activity from Client #12547 (Ahmed Ben Ali).

### **Detection Timeline**

| Time | Event | System Response |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 14:35:12 | Transfer of 150 TND to merchant | ✅ Processed normally |
| 14:35:45 | Transfer of 200 TND to different merchant | ⚠️ Velocity check triggered |
| 14:36:10 | Withdrawal of 500 TND from ATM | ⚠️ Velocity alert increased |
| 14:36:28 | Purchase of 1,200 TND (online) | 🚨 **FLAGGED - Velocity fraud** |
| 14:36:35 | Transfer of 800 TND | 🛑 **BLOCKED** |

### **Fraud Indicators**
1. **Velocity Pattern**: 5 transactions in 83 seconds
2. **Amount Escalation**: Progressive increase (150 → 200 → 500 → 1,200 TND)
3. **Channel Switching**: Mobile → ATM → Web
4. **Risk Score**: Increased from 15 → 75

### **SQL Detection Query**
```sql
-- Detect velocity fraud
EXEC sp_DetectVelocityFraud 
    @ClientID = 12547,
    @TimeWindowMinutes = 5,
    @MaxTransactions = 5;

SELECT 
    fa.AlertID,
    fa.AlertType,
    fa.Severity,

WHERE fa.ClientID = 12547
    AND fa.DetectedAt >= DATEADD(MINUTE, -10, GETDATE())
ORDER BY fa.DetectedAt DESC;
```

### **Dashboard Alert**
```

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### **Fraud Detection Effectiveness**

| KPI | Target | Formula |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **Detection Rate** | >95% | (Detected Fraud / Total Fraud) × 100 |
| **False Positive Rate** | <5% | (False Positives / Total Alerts) × 100 |
| **Average Detection Time** | <30 sec | AVG(Detection Time) |
| **Resolution Time** | <2 hours | AVG(Resolved Time - Detected Time) |

### **SQL Query for KPIs**
```sql
SELECT 
    -- Detection metrics
    COUNT(*) AS TotalAlerts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ResolvedAlerts,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Resolved' AND ResolutionNotes LIKE '%False Positive%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FalsePositives,
    
    -- Effectiveness rates
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS ResolutionRate,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Status = 'Resolved' AND ResolutionNotes LIKE '%False Positive%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS FalsePositiveRate,
    
    -- Timing metrics
    AVG(DATEDIFF(SECOND, DetectedAt, GETDATE())) AS AvgDetectionAgeSeconds,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(MINUTE, DetectedAt, ResolvedAt)) AS AvgResolutionTimeMinutes
FROM FraudAlerts
WHERE DetectedAt >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE());
```

Use these SQL scripts to simulate fraud scenarios for training:

```sql
-- Scenario 1: Simulate velocity fraud
EXEC sp_SimulateVelocityFraud @ClientID = 100;

-- Scenario 2: Simulate location fraud
EXEC sp_SimulateLocationFraud @ClientID = 200;
