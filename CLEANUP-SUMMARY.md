### With Documentation (Learning/Development)
Keep all files if you're:
- Learning the stack
- Troubleshooting issues
- Training others
- Need detailed references

## 🗑️ Safe to Delete

These files can be safely deleted as their fixes are now integrated:

```bash
# Remove fix scripts (fixes already in docker-compose.yml)
rm fix-time-sync.sh
rm fix-time-sync.ps1
rm fix-payment-api-health.sh
rm fix-payment-api-health.ps1
rm fix-ebanking-exporter.ps1

# Remove detailed troubleshooting docs (info in DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
rm TIME-SYNC-FIX.md
rm PAYMENT-API-HEALTH-FIX.md

# Remove migration notes (historical)
rm ebanking-exporter/MIGRATION-TO-PYTHON.md
```

## 📦 Archive Instead of Delete

If you want to keep these for reference:

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p archive/docs
mkdir -p archive/scripts

# Move files to archive
mv fix-*.sh fix-*.ps1 archive/scripts/
mv TIME-SYNC-FIX.md PAYMENT-API-HEALTH-FIX.md archive/docs/
mv WORKSHOP-COMPLETE-INSTALLATION.md grafana_workshop_pro.md archive/docs/
mv ebanking-exporter/MIGRATION-TO-PYTHON.md archive/docs/
```

## 🎯 Cleanup Commands

### Option 1: Minimal (Remove Fix Scripts Only)
```bash
cd observability-stack

# Remove fix scripts (fixes are in docker-compose.yml)
rm -f fix-time-sync.sh fix-time-sync.ps1
rm -f fix-payment-api-health.sh fix-payment-api-health.ps1
rm -f fix-ebanking-exporter.ps1
```

### Option 2: Production Ready (Remove All Optional)
```bash
cd observability-stack

# Remove fix scripts
rm -f fix-*.sh fix-*.ps1

# Remove detailed docs (keep main guides)
rm -f TIME-SYNC-FIX.md
rm -f PAYMENT-API-HEALTH-FIX.md
rm -f WORKSHOP-COMPLETE-INSTALLATION.md
rm -f grafana_workshop_pro.md

# Remove migration notes
rm -f ebanking-exporter/MIGRATION-TO-PYTHON.md
```

### Option 3: Archive Everything
```bash
cd observability-stack

# Create archive
mkdir -p archive/{scripts,docs}

# Move files
mv fix-*.sh fix-*.ps1 archive/scripts/ 2>/dev/null
mv *-FIX.md WORKSHOP-*.md grafana_workshop_pro.md archive/docs/ 2>/dev/null
mv ebanking-exporter/MIGRATION-TO-PYTHON.md archive/docs/ 2>/dev/null

# Create archive tarball
tar czf observability-stack-archive-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz archive/
rm -rf archive/
```

## ✅ After Cleanup

Your directory should look like:

```
observability-stack/
├── docker-compose.yml          ✅ Essential
├── deploy.sh                   ✅ Essential
├── .env                        ✅ Essential
├── .env.example               ✅ Essential
├── DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md        ✅ Main documentation
├── QUICK-START.md             ✅ Quick reference
├── README-EBANKING.md         ✅ Project info
├── ebanking-exporter/         ✅ Service
├── payment-api-mock/          ✅ Service
├── prometheus/                ✅ Config
├── grafana/                   ✅ Dashboards

├── influxdb/                  ✅ Config
└── workshops/                 ✅ Training (optional)
```

## 🔍 Verification

After cleanup, verify everything still works:

```bash
# Test deployment
./deploy.sh

# Should work without any issues
```

## 📝 What Each File Does

### Keep These
- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Defines all services, networks, volumes
- **`deploy.sh`** - Automates entire deployment process
- **`.env`** - Your specific configuration (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- **`DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`** - Complete deployment instructions
- **`QUICK-START.md`** - Fast reference for common tasks

### Can Remove These
- **`fix-*.sh/ps1`** - One-time fixes now integrated in docker-compose.yml
- **`*-FIX.md`** - Detailed troubleshooting (info now in DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
- **`WORKSHOP-*.md`** - Very detailed guides (optional for learning)
- **`MIGRATION-*.md`** - Historical migration notes

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Production Deployment:**
- Keep: Core files + DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
- Remove: Fix scripts and detailed troubleshooting docs
- Archive: Workshop materials for future reference

**For Learning/Development:**
- Keep everything
- Useful for understanding how issues were resolved
- Good reference material
